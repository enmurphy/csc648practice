        <h1>It me.</h1>
        <div>I'm Ericka Murphy, Team Lead of Group 01.
            <br>
            <br> I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii on March 23, 1994. I'm currently 
            pursuing a BS Degree in Computer Science at SFSU with the hopes that
            I'll someday work in the video game industry.
            <br>
            <br> When I have free time I'm either drawing or playing video games.</div>
